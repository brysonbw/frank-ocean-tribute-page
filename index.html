<h3>Who is Frank Ocean?</h3>
<p>Frank Ocean was born in Long Beach, California, on October 28, 1987. He grew up in New Orleans, but moved to Los Angeles in his late teens to pursue a career in music. Ocean started out ghostwriting tracks for such pop stars as Justin Bieber and Beyonc√©, but soon achieved fame as an artist when, in 2011, he released a mixtape of his own music, titled nostalgia, ULTRA. His next effort, channel ORANGE, was unveiled in 2012 to both critical and popular acclaim, and he followed with the back-to-back releases of Endless and Blonde in 2016.</p>
